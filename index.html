        <p class="post">Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry.
                     Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s,
                      when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type
                     specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into
                     electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in 
                     the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages,
                      and more recently  with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker 
                      including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p>
